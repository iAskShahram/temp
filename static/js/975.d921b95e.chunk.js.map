Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing\r\n\t\t\t\tand typesetting industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard\r\n\t\t\t\tdummy text ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley\r\n\t\t\t\tof type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived\r\n\t\t\t\tnot only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,\r\n\t\t\t\tremaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s with\r\n\t\t\t\tthe release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages, and more\r\n\t\t\t\trecently with desktop publishing software like Aldus PageMaker including\r\n\t\t\t\tversions of Lorem Ipsum. Why do we use it? It is a long established fact\r\n\t\t\t\tthat a reader will be distracted by the readable content of a page when\r\n\t\t\t\tlooking at its layout. The point of using Lorem Ipsum is that it has a\r\n\t\t\t\tmore-or-less normal distribution of letters, as opposed to using\r\n\t\t\t\t'Content here, content here', making it look like readable English.\r\n\t\t\t</p>\r\n\t\t</div>\r\n\t);\r\n}\r\n"],"names":["About","props","useTitle","className"],"sourceRoot":""}
